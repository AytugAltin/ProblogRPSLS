\section{Conclusion}
DeepProbLog is relatively easier to scale compared to a normal CNN. The CNN took longer to reach an accuracy of 100\%, especially when the model gets more complex it  takes a substantial amount of time. Integrating probabilistic logic programming makes the network train faster. Since the rules are defined in a separate model, these can be easily extended while their corresponding neural networks barely have to change to cope with an increase in complexity in the problem. Giving additional information to the model with these predicates we can increase performance: 100\% accuracy is achieved faster. Incorporating logic programming looks promising and is worth exploring. We have shown that DeepProbLog can be used to optimise the performance of a CNN model when rules about the game or problem can be clearly defined.
