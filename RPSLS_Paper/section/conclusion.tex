\section{Conclusion}
DeepProbLog is relatively easier to scale compared to a normal CNN. The CNN took longer until it gave an accuracy of 100\% especially when the model gets more complex, it will take an substantial amount of time. Integrating probabilistic logic programming makes the network train faster. Since the rules are defined in a separate model, these can be easily extended while the neural networks barely has to change to cope with an increase in complexity.
