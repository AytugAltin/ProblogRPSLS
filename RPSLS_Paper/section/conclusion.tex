\section{Conclusion}
DeepProbLog is relatively easier to scale compared to a normal CNN. The CNN took longer until it gave an accuracy of 100\% especially when the model gets more complex it will take a substantial amount of time. Integrating probabilistic logic programming makes the network train faster. Since the rules are defined in a separate model, these can be easily extended while their corresponding neural networks barely have to change to cope with an increase in complexity. Giving additional information to the model by these predicates we can increase performance: 100\% accuracy is achieved faster. Incorporating logic programming looks promising and is worth continuing research.
