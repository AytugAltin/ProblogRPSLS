\section{Introduction}
DeepProbLog \cite{DBLP} can be used to incorporate logical predicates into neural network model. Here, we try to compare the a DeepProbLog model with a normal CNN by training it on the simple game rock paper scissors. Testing if the DeepProbLog model has an advantage over the normal CNN is the goal of this experiment. By increasing the complexity of the game, which is done by te adding 2 additional possible gestures lizard and spock, it is possible to look at the effect on the models.
