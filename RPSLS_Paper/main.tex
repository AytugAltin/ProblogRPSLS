\begin{abstract}
	DeepProblog, logic programming incorporated with deep learning, is evaluated by making it learn what the result is of the game rock paper scissors and the extension rock paper scissors lizard spock. The model is evaluated and compared to a CNN that does not incorporate any aspect of logic programming. In our experiments, the DeepProbLog implementation has a better performance than the standard CNN model.
